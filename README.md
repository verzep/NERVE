# Neural Environment for Random Variable Estimation (NERVE)

### By Pietro Verzelli


This is is a C++ code implementing two classes (`NeuralNetwork` and `Neuron`) to simulate the activity of a small neural network, generating Spike Trains (STs). Neurons' activity is simulated evolving their membrane potentials (MPs), modeled as a stochastic process. Connections among neurons may be introduced, creating a (small) Neural Network which allows neurons to communicate via spikes.

## Introduction

The programs consists of the following parts

- `class_Neuron` : is used to implement istances of `Neuron` (`.h` is the header file while `.cpp` is the implementation)
- `class_NeuralNetwork` : is used to implement istances of `NeuralNetwork` (`.h` is the header file while `.cpp` is the implementation)
- `class_statistic`: contains some useful functions, used in the earlier versions of the code (`.h` is the header file while `.cpp` is the implementation)
